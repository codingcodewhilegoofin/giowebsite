      <h4>Who is Giovanni Moscato? </h4>
      <p>I started programming about 4 years ago at my community college and began to grow more interest in it as I progressed through school. 
        Originally I was going to school for VFX or some kind of art program. 
        I have always had a love for art and music but I also wanted to work in the tech industry. 
        My dream career would involve combing technology and art together to create experiences that users really love. 
        At the moment I have a wide range of experience in programming and design aspects. 
        Currently I am trying to figure out what emphasis of programming I'd like to focus on. 
        Recently I have begun to explore Machine Learning! 
        I plan to keep growing my developer knowledge while letting my creative side flourish with new projects on Github!
