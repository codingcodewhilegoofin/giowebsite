      <h4>Who is Giovanni Moscato? </h4>
      <p>I started programming about 4 years ago at my community college and began to grow more interest in it as I progressed through school. 
        Originally I was going to school for VFX or some kind of art program. 
        I have always had a love for art and music but I also wanted to work in the tech industry. 
        My dream career would involve combing technology and art together to create experiences that users really love. 
        At the moment I have a decent range of experience in programming and design aspects. 
        Currently I am trying to figure out what niche of programming I'd like to focus on. 
        Recently I have begun to explore Machine Learning and Web Dev!
